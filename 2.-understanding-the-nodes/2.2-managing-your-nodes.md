# 2.2 - Managing your nodes

The size of your nodes can range from 100 LVT to Infinity and beyond.

Once you have created a node, you cannot sell it. But you will get at least 15% of your node size every month, forever.

Once your nodes have been created, they will appear on the [**dashboard**](https://www.louverture.finance/application)**.**

Your nodes cannot be transferred to another wallet.

Your rewards will accumulate until you claim or compound.
