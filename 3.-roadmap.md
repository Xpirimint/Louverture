# 3. Roadmap

We are looking to attract the best devs, farmers, researchers, and marketers to make LVT one of the top projects on Avalanche.

We will seek to invest our treasury in top high-yield DeFi protocols.

There is a constant flow of ideas from both the team and community, to whom we are infinitely grateful. If you have any suggestions, we will listen.

We are looking to do a 3rd party KYC with a platform such as Rug Doc or Assure.&#x20;

We are also in communication with Certik, about a full audit of our smart contract. This will likely take around a week to complete.
