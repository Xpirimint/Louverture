# 1.1 What is Louverture?

Louverture (The Opening) has been designed to open the doors of DeFi to anyone, through a multi-chain Yield Processing Node.

In a nutshell, we aim to do **DeFi-as-a-Service**. Instead of navigating blindly between the 300 different protocols (and scams) in DeFi, you would just have to use one token and one platform **: Louverture**.

The idea behind this project is to enable noders to invest in multiple DeFi high-yield protocols, without having to find the best ones all by themselves. Without having to pay for the network fees, do the manual swapping, bridging, staking, bonding, etc.

This protocol will be governed by noders who will vote towards which protocol to allocate which % of the funds.&#x20;

We also aim at becoming a decentralized VC. We will be investing and incubating early stage projects, profits of which will be used redistributed to noders, increasing the overall APR.
