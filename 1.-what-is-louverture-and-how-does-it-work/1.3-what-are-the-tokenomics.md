# 1.3 - What are the tokenomics?

The total supply is 1 billion LVT tokens.

For every node creation:

* 70% goes to the [distribution pool](1.5-i-have-noticed-that-there-was-a-wallet-holding-a-large-amount-of-lvt-tokens.md)
* 20% goes to the [treasury](https://snowtrace.io/address/0x482b272af360fdfbf2d6f9b688ce949ae6adc117)
* 10% is added to LP

There is a 10% fee to the treasury when claiming, which gets converted to AVAX.\
\
The LVT-nodes yield at least 15% per month.
