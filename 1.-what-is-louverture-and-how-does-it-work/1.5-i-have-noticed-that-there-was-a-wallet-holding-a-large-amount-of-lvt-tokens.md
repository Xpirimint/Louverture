# 1.5 - I have noticed that there was a wallet holding a large amount of LVT tokens

The [50+% wallet](https://snowtrace.io/token/0xff579d6259dedcc80488c9b89d2820bcb5609160?a=0x051d6213f7186f31f40f3e2ac9e7c8c682fdf1c9) is the reserve / distribution pool wallet. 70% of the LVT tokens used to create nodes are sent there. It is used to pay rewards to noders. It basically is the runway, how long we can continue paying rewards if nobody creates nodes ever again.\
\
This wallet is NOT controlled by a whale that can dump the price of LVT. You can verify transparently on Snowtrace that this wallet has NEVER been used to sell large amounts of LVT tokens.
