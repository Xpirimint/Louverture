# 1.7 - Which DeFi yield protocols are currently used by Louverture Nodes ?

Louverture has just been launched (this means that you are still very early) so our current focus is to ensure the stability and growth of **Louverture**, leveraging its powerful tokenomics designed for a **steady growth**.\
\
We are currently studying various protocols on different chains, planning a second project benefiting the Louverture ecosystem, as well as becoming a decentralized VC. We will be investing and incubating early stage projects, profits of which will be used redistributed to noders.
